    <h2>ABOUT NIFFT</h2>
    <p id="p1">National Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, (erstwhile National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology), Ranchi was established in 1966 by Government of India with the assistance of UNESCO as a specialized institutes in the country, to fulfill the demand of technical manpower in manufacturing sector. The particular emphasis was on Foundry and Forge Technology to meet the demand of trained manpower in the primary metal manufacturing sectors like automobile, heavy engineering, machine, and component manufacturing etc. Two carefully designed advanced diploma courses, namely Foundry Technology and Forge Technology were offered. To push forward the knowledge boundary, four M. Tech programs were introduced, viz. Foundry & Forge Technology, Manufacturing Engineering, Material Science and Engineering, and Environmental Engineering. Subsequently, two B. Tech programs, one in Metallurgical & Materials Engineering and the other in Manufacturing Engineering, were started to reinforce the core framework of Foundry and Forging Technology with the knowledge of materials and manufacturing, and low or no-waste generation. All these catered to the emerging need of the industries. These courses are supported by Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry, Engineering Mathematics, Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, and Humanities & Industrial Management. Recently, the institute has formed a new department, Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, and this year onwards the institute is going to start two new B.Tech courses viz. Electronics & Computer Engineering, and Production & Industrial Engineering.</p>
